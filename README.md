Welcome to the ADM UDF Lab.


In this scenario, PlatOps team has done all the hard work of installing everything for you, now you just need to do some clickops.

There is a Coffee application which lives on the www box.  

The application FQDN is http://www.udf.com

Use ADM to deploy this application on the west gateway.

The udf.com domain lives only within the blueprint

You can use your regular RDP client to RDP to the Kali box to test it, login to kali with kali/kali, then run firefox and browse to the front half of your proxy (gateway)

Here is the Lab diagram:
